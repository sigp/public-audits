# Havven Review 

In order to run these tests, artifacts of the contracts need to be built. This
is done via 

```
$ node magic-compile.js
```

The node modules need to be installed, 

```
$ npm install
```

and a ganache-like client needs to be running, i.e 

```
$ ganache-cli
```

The tests can then be executed via 

```
truffle test
```
